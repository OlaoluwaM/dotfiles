# Dotfiles

A set of configuration files for my dev environment.

There is also a node script for automating the creation of symlinks.
This script takes in the name (in lowercase) of the linux distro where you want to grab dotfiles from prefixed with a `--`

For example `node makeSymlinks.js --fedora`

You may need to make this file executable first
